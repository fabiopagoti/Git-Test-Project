I'll commit stuff without git add.. won't I?

Haha! It seems not... not for new files at least. Please add me first, then change me and try:

git commit -m -a

Ok, so I have added the file.. but of course I need to change it (using this line) to test git commit -a

OMG!! Worked!!! After commit the modified file not tracked was commited... next topic.

By the way, -a is the option which skips staging area
